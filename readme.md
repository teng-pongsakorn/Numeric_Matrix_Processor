#[Project: Numeric Matrix Processor](https://hyperskill.org/projects/60)

## About
Hereâ€™s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

## Learning outcomes
Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using arrays in practice.

## What you'll do and what you'll learn
* **Stage 1/6: Addition**
  * Use multi-dimensional arrays to add matrices.
* **Stage 2/6: Multiplication by number**
  * Learn to multiply a matrix by a number and display the result.
* **Stage 3/6: Matrix by matrix multiplication**
  * Multiply matrices and create a menu where you can list all the awesome abilities of your matrix processor.
* **Stage 4/6: Transpose**
  * Add another useful operation to your processor: allow matrix transposition, and then add this option to the menu.
* **Stage 5/6: Determined!**
  * Use recursion to enable your program to find the determinant.
* **Stage 6/6: Inverse matrix**
  * Yet another possible operation is finding the inverse of a matrix: add this option to your program.
